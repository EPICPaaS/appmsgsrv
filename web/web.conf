# Web configuration file example

# Note on units: when memory size is needed, it is possible to specify
# it in the usual form of 1k 5GB 4M and so forth:
#
# 1kb => 1024 bytes
# 1mb => 1024*1024 bytes
# 1gb => 1024*1024*1024 bytes
#
# units are case insensitive so 1GB 1Gb 1gB are all the same.

# Note on units: when time duration is needed, it is possible to specify
# it in the usual form of 1s 5M 4h and so forth:
#
# 1s => 1000 * 1000 * 1000 nanoseconds
# 1m => 60 seconds
# 1h => 60 minutes
#
# units are case insensitive so 1h 1H are all the same.

# Examples
# http.bind localhost:8090
# http.bind 192.168.1.100:8090,192.168.1.101:8090
# http.bind 0.0.0.0:8090
http.bind 192.168.2.12:8090

# Web service http listen and server on this address, default localhost:8091
# mainly servers for internal admin
# Examples
# tcp.bind localhost:8091
# tcp.bind 192.168.1.100:8091,192.168.1.101:8091
# tcp.bind 0.0.0.0:8091

# This call will go away when the scheduler improves. By default the number of 
# logical CPUs is set.

# This is used by web service profiling (pprof).
# By default web pprof listens for connections from local interfaces on 8190
# port. It's not safty for listening internet IP addresses.
#
# Examples:
#
# pprof.bind 192.168.1.100:8190,10.0.0.1:8190
# pprof.bind 127.0.0.1:8190
# pprof.bind 0.0.0.0:8190
pprof.bind 192.168.2.12:8190

# If the master process is run as root, then web will setuid()/setgid() 
# to USER/GROUP. If GROUP is not specified, then web uses the same name as 
# USER. By default it's nobody user and nobody or nogroup group.
user ghg

# When running daemonized, Web writes a pid file in 
# /tmp/gopush-cluster-web.pid by default. You can specify a custom pid file 
# location here.
pidfile /tmp/gopush-cluster-web.pid

# The working directory.
#
# The log will be written inside this directory, with the filename specified
# above using the 'logfile' configuration directive.
#  
# Note that you must specify a directory here, not a file name.

[zookeeper]
# The provided servers parameter may include multiple server addresses, separated
# by commas, so that the client will automatically attempt to connect
# to another server if one of them stops working for whatever reason.
# Used for exmple following
# addr IP1:Port1,IP2:Port2,IP3:Port3
addr  10.180.120.111:8011

# The timeout parameter, given in nanoseconds, allows controlling
# the amount of time the zookeeper connection can stay unresponsive before the
# zookeeper server will be considered problematic.

# It will ping rpc service per ping time to confirm connecting is alive

[redis]
# Close connections after remaining idle for this duration. If the value
# is zero, then idle connections are not closed. Applications should set

# The format like "NodeName IP:Port", NodeName was specified by Comet service.
# If there are multiple nodes, then configure following
